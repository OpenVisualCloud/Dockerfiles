### Customize Build Process:   

You can use the following build options to customize the build process:   
- **BUILD_MP3LAME**: Set to ```ON``` (default) to build the ```libmp3lame``` in the docker images, or ```OFF``` to disable including ```libmp3lame``` in the docker images.    
- **BUILD_FDKAAC**: Set to ```ON``` (default) to build the ```libfdk_aac``` in the docker images, or ```OFF``` to disable including ```libfdk_aac``` in the docker images.  
- **UPDATE_DOCKERFILES**: Set to ```ON``` to update the Dockerfiles only without actually building them, or ```OFF``` (default) to update and build the Dockerfiles.   
- **UPDATE_IMAGELIST**: Set to ```ON``` to update the image list in each platform README.md.  
- **UPDATE_DOCKERHUB_README**: Set to ```ON``` to upload image README.md to docker hub.  

Build examples:   

```
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_MP3LAME=ON ..
```

```
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_FDKAAC=ON -DBUILD_MP3LAME=OFF ..
```

### Use Alternative Repo:

Certain source repo might be blocked in certain network. You can specify alternative repos before the build command as follows:

```bash
export AOM_REPO=...       
export VPX_REPO=...     
make
```

For a list of all REPOs and their versions, run the following command:

```bash
grep -E '_(REPO|VER)=' template/*.m4         
```
